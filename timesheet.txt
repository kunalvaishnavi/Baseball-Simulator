Timesheet by Kunal Vaishnavi

Date | Hours | Description
——————————————————————————
8/3  |   3   | Worked on tasks for TP1 (project proposal, competitive 
		analysis, and timesheet)
——————————————————————————
8/4  |   2   | Finished tasks for TP1 (mainly worked on competitive analysis 				today)
——————————————————————————
8/5  |   10  | Started hardcoding all values for batters and pitchers into 2 CSV files. 
		Thought of algorithms to implement by first conducting research on 
		already-existing ones.
——————————————————————————
8/6  |   15  | Finished hardcoding all values. Have decided to develop constants with 
		statistics using recursion in order to create algorithms. Created several 
		Python files (Batter.py, Pitcher.py, Algorithms.py, Dictionaries.py, 
		Simulator.py). 
——————————————————————————
8/7  |   5   | Worked to get simulator to B-level, as stated in requirements. It can now 
		predict results of a matchup between two teams.
——————————————————————————
8/8  |   15  | Worked on receiving 100% accurate box score and 100% accurate summary of 
		scoring. Simulator now tracks the runners and moves them around 
		accordingly. Situations such as the batter walking with runners on second 
		and third have been accounted for. Worked on UI for the simulator (created 
		UI.py for this).
——————————————————————————
8/9  |   5   | Created, edited, and uploaded to YouTube a presentation video about the 
		simulator. Also create readme.txt, which explains my project and how to 
		run the simulator.
